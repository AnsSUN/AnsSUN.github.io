This blog post is about my design work while I graduated after my Bachelor's degree from MANIT, Bhopal until I joined Airbus on behalf of L&T Technology Services. There are many mechanical parts and assemblies I designed in Creo Parametric software, learned from the CADD center. After joining Airbus, I started using CATIA V5 software for mechanical components design and product management. There are many CAD assemblies that I completed as a hobby or interest in design. Moreover, I have accomplished some Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation for microturbine. You can find my work in the publication section. If you want to learn more about my simulation work, please contact me via email.
