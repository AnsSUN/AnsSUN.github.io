title: "PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF AN AIR OPERATED MICROTURBINE"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper is about the performance analysis of an microturbine which we developed to scavange the waste energy through compressed exhaust gas and generate electricity. This was the initial iteration product of an impulse microturbine. This had efficiency of 4 to 5 percent. After so many iterations in design, its efficiency would increase and can be use as a small portable energy generating device.'
