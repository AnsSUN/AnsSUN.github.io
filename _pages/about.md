Hi, I am Anshul, Robotics Engineer/ Researcher/ Mechanical Design Engineer or student etc. I am a graduate student at the University of Washington, Seattle. My primary research interest is in Robotics and to make them as intelligent as possible. I have diverse experience from core Mechanical Design to Software development for controls and Intelligence to Robots- I had done it all. I like to stay on top of my personal development and look for ways to continuously enhance my skills through development opportunities which made it possible for me to have a diverse knowledge of different domains.

Some of my coursework involves estimation and prediction in controls and AI. Moreover, I am working in Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) at UW ecocar Lab. where we have successfully detected vehicles and brake light using computer vision algorithms with high accuracy.

Outside of my coursework at the University of Washington, I have experience working as a Mechanical Design Engineer in the field of Product design through 3-D CAD software. In addition, I worked at Airbus deputed by L&T Technology Services in which I contributed to increasing the productivity of the team which to 98% to ensure on-time deliveries of drawings.

I believe these experiences provide me an edge to solve technical driven problems of “robotics” in a different perspective. Doing this I hope I contribute and make a difference for the society. As the world is changing very rapidly, these technological advancements require some of the different domains of knowledge to solve problems in the right way.
