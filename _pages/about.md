Hi, I am Anshul, Robotics Engineer, Researcher, Mechanical Design Engineer or student etc. I am graduate student at University of Washington, Seattle. My primary research interest is in Robotics and to make them as intelligent as possible. I have so much diverse experience from core Mechanical Design to Software development for controls and Intelligence for Robotics. I am a quick learner which made me possible to have so much diverse knowledge of different domain.  

As a Graduate student at the University of Washington, I have acquired/acquiring knowledge in robotics . Some of my coursework involve estimation and prediction controls and Artificial Intelligence domain.  Moreover, I am working in Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) at UW ecocar Lab. where we are detecting vehicles and brake light using computer vision algorithms. 

Outside of my coursework at University of Washington, I have experience working as a design engineer which furnished me in the field of mechanical design through 3-D CAD software. Moreover, working in Airbus deputed by L&T Technology Services had provided me to achieve high productivity to match the on-time deliveries of drawings which is also great demonstration of team work.

I believe such diverse experience in different domains would provide me an ability to solve the problems of multidisciplinary field "robotics" in a different perspective. I hope I would contribute and make a difference for the society. As the world is changing very rapidly, these technological advancements require some of the different domain knowledge to solve problems right away.
