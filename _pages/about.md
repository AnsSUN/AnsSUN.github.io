Hi, I am Anshul, Robotics Engineer/ Researcher/ Mechanical Design Engineer or student etc. I am graduate student at University of Washington, Seattle. My primary research interest is in Robotics and to make them as intelligent as possible. I have diverse experience from core Mechanical Design to Software development for controls and Intelligence to Robots. I would like to stay on top of my personal development and looks for ways to continuously enhance my skills through development opportunities which made me possible to have so much diverse knowledge of different domain.  

As a Graduate student at the University of Washington, I have acquired/acquiring knowledge in robotics. Some of my coursework involve estimation and prediction controls and Artificial Intelligence domain.  Moreover, I am working in Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) at UW ecocar Lab. where we have successfully detected vehicles and brake light using computer vision algorithms at high accuracy rate. 

Outside of my coursework at University of Washington, I have experience working as a Mechanical Design engineer which furnished me in the field of Product design through 3-D CAD software. Moreover, working in Airbus deputed by L&T Technology Services had provided me to achieve high productivity to the team which was about 98% to match the on-time deliveries of drawings.

I believe such experiences would provide me an ability to solve the problems of "robotics" in a different perspective. I hope I would contribute and make a difference for the society. As the world is changing very rapidly, these technological advancements require some of the different domain knowledge to solve problems right away.
