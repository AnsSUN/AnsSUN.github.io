Hi, I am Robotics Engineer/ Controls Engineer/ Mechanical Design Engineer etc. I graduated at the University of Washington, Seattle. My primary research interest is in Robotics and to make them as intelligent as possible. I have diverse experience from core Mechanical Design to Software development for controls and Intelligence to Robots. I always look for ways to continuously enhance my skills through development opportunities which made it possible for me to have a diverse knowledge of different domains.

Some of my coursework involves estimation and prediction in controls and Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, I worked in Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) at EcoCAR where I have successfully developed and implemented the distance maintanince algorithm for mobile robots. Moreover, I also accomplished by implementing vehicles and brake light detection using computer vision algorithms with high accuracy.

Outside of my coursework at the University of Washington, I have experience working as a Mechanical Design Engineer in the field of Product design through 3-D CAD software. In addition, I worked at Airbus deputed by L&T Technology Services in which I contributed to increasing the productivity of the team which to 98% to ensure on-time deliveries of drawings.

I believe these experiences provide me an edge to solve technical driven problems of “robotics” in a different perspective. Doing this I hope I contribute and make a difference for the society. As the world is changing very rapidly, these technological advancements require some of the different domains of knowledge to solve problems in the right way.
