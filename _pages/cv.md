Education
======
* M.S. in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics), [University of Washington, Seattle](http://www.washington.edu/)
  * Date: December 2019
  * Advisor: Professor [Brian Fabien](https://www.me.washington.edu/people/faculty/brian_fabien)
* B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering, [National Institute of Technology, Bhopal](http://www.manit.ac.in/)
  * Date: November 2014 
  * Senior Thesis: DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF MICRO TURBINE
  * Advisor: Professor [Rajesh Gupta](http://www.manit.ac.in/content/dr-rajesh-gupta)

Work experience
======
* Researcher for Connected Automated Vehicle (CAV), Feb. 2018 - Present
  * [UW EcoCAR](https://uwecocarcom.wixsite.com/website)
   1. Developed and implemented Proportional (P), Proportional-Integral (PI) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for mobile robots to maintain the safe distance by varying the velocity. It involves detections from the camera, rotating Laser sensor which sensor fused them to localize the robot for longitudinal autonomy. Velocity is estimated through Kalman Filter from distance sensors. MPC is more aggressive than P and PI control algorithms. 
  2. Developed a sophisticated system in C++/MatLab to detect brake-light of different vehicles through Computer Vision algorithm like convex hull with specific RGB and HSV parameters at different environmental conditions.
  3. Co-developed a precise vehicle detection system using C++/MatLab by training it through vehicle data-set and eliminate false negatives to obtain very good results.
  * Advisor: Professor [Brian Fabien](https://www.me.washington.edu/people/faculty/brian_fabien)

* Engineer
  * Deputed to [Airbus India](https://www.airbus.com/company/worldwide-presence/india.html) on behalf of [L&T Technology Services Limited](https://www.lnttechservices.com/)
    * Design Engineer for [Airbus Helicopters](https://www.airbus.com/helicopters.html) 
      1. Completed eccentric shaft mechanism design by assisting in Concept Design of Helicopter Test bench in CATIA V5.
      2. Attained over 90% productivity on complex sheet-metal, assembly drawings such as assembly drawing of electrical equipment installation structure in cockpit respecting Airbus standards.

    * Equipment Model Manager
      1. Obtained over 98% productivity for verification and validation of suppliers 3-D C.A.D. Models (in CATIA V5 and PDMLINK CC)with respect to specialzation and its functional requirements such as Galley installation while placing in the compartments.
      2. Created Space Allocation 3D-CAD Models for different systems and provided Technical Validation support of 3-D C.A.D. Models.
