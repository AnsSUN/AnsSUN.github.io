1. We devised the algorithm which could be useful in planning strategy for pickup the identified object by doing this task in effective manner.
<br/><br/>
2. Accomplished pick and place task by developing algorithm for smart planning strategy with 2-D to 3-D coordinate transformation.
<br/><br/>
3. Successfully detected the different types of occluded objects in the environment on vision sensor using V-Rep and MatLab software.
