1. A 6m long wooden track was set up to maintain the straight line motion of the turtlebot burger3 robots.
<br/><br/>
2. Information from the camera and rotating laser distance sensor are fused together. Kalman filter was used to get rid of the noise of the sensor and different controllers were tested on the robot.
