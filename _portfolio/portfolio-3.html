1. Achieved control of the Ball-bot system for balancing at different electric motor torque during the course of its motion. 
<br/><br/>
2. Designed the linear system of this Ball-bot at its equilibrium point. 
<br/><br/>
3. Devised the non-linear system model for Ball-bot to analyze its controllability and stability.
