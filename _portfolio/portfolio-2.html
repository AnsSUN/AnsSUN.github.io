1. There was optimal control of the quad-rotor system for balancing at different thrusts and torques during the course of its motion. This motion was Linearize at its equilibrium point to achieve balancing. 
<br/><br/>
2. A non-linear system model for this system was devised for its controllability and stability.
<br/><br/>
3. Implemented Linear Quadratic Regulation and kalman filter model to this linear system to estimate the position of Quadrocopter.
